ðŸš€ Crypto Transaction Tracing and Analysis

###Overview
This project focuses on tracing cryptocurrency transactions back to the end users by analyzing their behavior patterns. Using advanced data analysis techniques, we search for anomalies within transaction sets to detect suspicious or fraudulent activities. This tool will be invaluable for financial institutions, regulatory bodies, and others interested in tracking the flow of digital assets.

Key Features

Behavioral Analysis: Track user activities to uncover patterns and correlations.
Anomaly Detection: Spot irregularities in transactions to flag potential risks.
End-to-End Tracing: Accurately trace transactions to the final user.
User-Friendly Dashboard: Real-time visualization of transaction flows and detected anomalies.
Technologies Used

Python: Data analysis and machine learning, with libraries like TensorFlow and Scikit-Learn.
Solidity: Development of smart contracts on the Ethereum blockchain.
MERN Stack: Web application development using MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js.
MySQL: Management and storage of relational database information.
Flask: Integration and deployment of web services and APIs.
Project Workflow

Data Collection: Gather transaction data from the blockchain.
Data Cleaning: Process and clean the data for analysis.
Behavior Analysis: Employ machine learning to identify user behavior patterns.
Anomaly Detection: Detect unusual activities or irregular transaction flows.
Tracing: Map the transaction trail to the end user.
